<summary>üöÄ Day 1 Plan: Diving into C++ üöÄ</summary>

Welcome to **Day 1** of your C++ learning , goals:


## üìö **Goal 1: Learn Something New About C++**
Today, we‚Äôll explore **core C++ concepts** that are fundamental to the language. Here‚Äôs what to focus on:

1. **Data Types and Variables**:  
   - Learn about primitive data types like `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `bool`.  
   - Understand how to declare and initialize variables.

      - **Article**: [Lambda Expressions](https://harmash.com/tutorials/cplusplus/lambda-expressions)

        
4. **Pointers**:  
   - Understand the concept of pointers and their usage.  
   - Learn about pointer declaration, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic.  
   - **Reference**:  
     - **Video**: [Pointers in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIL2BK02X8A) (full course)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Goal 2: Implement What You‚Äôve Learned**
Let‚Äôs apply the new concepts in practical ways. Here‚Äôs what to do:

1. **Experiment with Pointers**:  
   - Write a small program to swap two numbers using pointers.  
      - **Exercise To Do**:  
         - **Websites**:  ([w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/exercise.asp?x=xrcise_pointers1)) & ([erlerobotics](https://erlerobotics.gitbooks.io/erle-robotics-cpp-gitbook/content/pointers/exercises_pointers.html)) & ([geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quizzes/quiz-cpp-pointers/))

2. **Experiment with Lambda**:  
   - Create a program that uses a lambda function to perform operations on an array. For example, dynamically allocate memory for an array, fill it with values, and use a lambda to process the array (e.g., calculate the sum, filter values, or apply transformations). Finally, deallocate the memory.

## ÔøΩ **Goal 3: Learn and Solve Problems in Data Structures**
Let‚Äôs start with a simple Data Structure topic in C++. Here‚Äôs what to focus on:

1. **Learn About Arrays**:  
   - Understand how arrays work in C++ (fixed-size, contiguous memory).  
   - Learn how to declare, initialize, and traverse arrays.  
   - **Reference**:  
     - **Video**: [Arrays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FVBeLD_FdE)

# üó∫Ô∏è What roadmap will be used?
- We will use this road map:
[RoadMap](https://github.com/salmer/CppDeveloperRoadmap)
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9a22b18-f32e-45e3-addb-4707dd105a9c)

# üéØ **How the Plan Will Work?**
We will create a **daily learning streak** to help you manage the language quickly and effectively. Each day, you‚Äôll focus on three key goals to ensure steady progress:

 - **Learn something new about C++** (beyond the basics). ‚úÖ  
 - **Implement what you‚Äôve learned** in different ways, ideas, or mini-projects. ‚úÖ  
 - learn and **Solve problems** in Data Structure (related or unrelated to the day‚Äôs topic). ‚úÖ  

By following this structure, you‚Äôll build a strong foundation while applying your knowledge in practical ways. Let‚Äôs make learning fun. üöÄ
